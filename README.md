 ## Creating a easy to use desktop shortcut:
 
 - Create a desktop shortcut for powershell.exe and name it "hostedit"
 - Edit its properties and add c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hostedit_v02.ps1 
   at the end of the target line leaving a space after "powershell.exe"
 - When needed, right click on the shortcut and run as administrator
 
 For Windows11:
 
 - Install the last version of Powershell (tested with 7)
 - Go to "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\" and
   Create a desktop shortcut for pwsh.exe and name it "hostedit"
 - Edit its properties and add c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hostedit_v02.ps1 
   at the end of the target line leaving a space after "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe"
 - When needed, right click on the shortcut and run as administrator
